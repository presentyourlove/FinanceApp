# User Preferences

1.  **Error Handling & Permissions**: When generating code or answering questions, if you encounter a problem you cannot handle or an error; or when modifying code, if you find you lack permission to continue fixing a defect or error, please **STOP**. Do not continue generating. Instead, point out the difficulty encountered and provide a solution for me to handle it myself.

2.  **Language**: Please use Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) for ALL responses and artifacts (including Implementation Plans, Goals, etc.).

3.  **Plan Before Action**: Do not execute any code modifications directly. Always provide an implementation plan first. The plan must be divided into distinct phases/stages. Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.

4.  **Web Development Guidelines**: When developing web applications, prioritize the following:
    *   **Environment & Languages**:
        *   HTML / CSS / SCSS: Use HTML5, CSS3, and SCSS.
        *   Responsive Design (RWD): Ensure proper display on all devices.
