1.  **Error Handling & Permissions**: When generating code or answering questions, if you encounter a problem you cannot handle or an error; or when modifying code, if you find you lack permission to continue fixing a defect or error, please **STOP**. Do not continue generating. Instead, point out the difficulty encountered and provide a solution for me to handle it myself.

2.  **Language**: Please use Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) for ALL responses, including implementation plans, goals, and explanations.
